# `mfnet` vs `pytorch` - Basic ML Tasks Comparison

This repository focuses on comparing basic Machine Learning (ML) tasks using `pytorch` with the same tasks using `mfnet`, the ML library developed as a final project for the Deep Learning exam.

The two libraries will be used to perform two basic tasks: regression on the California Housing dataset, and classification on MNIST.
